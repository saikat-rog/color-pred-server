/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `otp_sessions` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `otp_sessions` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `refresh_tokens` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `refresh_tokens` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `users` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `users` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `user_id` on the `refresh_tokens` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
